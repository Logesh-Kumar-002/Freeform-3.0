BUILD_GUIDE - how to build the APK (generated 2025-11-08T15:13:55.434652 UTC)

This package contains:
- the reorganized Android project (root where settings.gradle(.kts) exists)
- Dockerfile.android (self-contained builder)
- .github/workflows/docker-build-android.yml (CI workflow that builds with Docker)

OPTIONS TO BUILD:

1) Build with Android Studio (recommended)
   - Open Android Studio -> Open project -> select this project root.
   - Let Studio download SDK components if prompted.
   - Build -> Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) -> Build APK(s).
   - APK will be at app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

2) Build locally with Docker (no Android SDK install)
   - Install Docker on your machine.
   - From project root run:
     docker build -f Dockerfile.android -t mi-freeform-build .
     docker create --name tmp mi-freeform-build
     docker cp tmp:/project/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk ./app-debug.apk
     docker rm tmp
   - Install the APK on your device with: adb install -r app-debug.apk

3) Build via GitHub Actions (automatic on push to main)
   - Push this repository to GitHub (branch main).
   - The included workflow (.github/workflows/docker-build-android.yml) will run. Wait for the build to finish.
   - Download the artifact 'app-debug-apk' from the Actions run when complete.

NOTES:
- This Dockerfile installs Android platforms 27..31 and build-tools 31.0.0 for compatibility with Android 8.1 through Android 12.
- If your project requires a specific build-tools version, edit Dockerfile.android and the workflow to match.
- If gradle wrapper (gradlew) is missing, the Dockerfile falls back to system 'gradle' (installed via apt). For reproducible builds, add the Gradle wrapper to the repo.
